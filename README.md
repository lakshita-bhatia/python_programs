####This repository consist of the python programs which I have developed during the python learning period.

#Take A Break
====================
### This progam help you to take a break from your long working day by playing for you, your favourite music video.

#Change File name
====================

### This program can be used in treasure hunting or in order to execute a prank, Unzip the file folder, change the location in the program and see the magic.

#Draw figure
======================

###This program exploits the graphical capabilities of the python 'turtle' library. In this program I have added few simple figures like square, circle, triangle, rhombus as well as complex figures like flower, pattern etc.
